C.H.A.R.L.I.E. v2 is an embedded solution for automatically watering
and monitoring a limited number of houseplants. Features include an
eye-catching web interface and support for logging plant status and
download of the said data onto a PC for analysis.

The project is undergoing major refactoring pending its final version,
so documentation, code and schematics from the previous iteration are
still being reviewed pending their upload to the repository in the near
future.
