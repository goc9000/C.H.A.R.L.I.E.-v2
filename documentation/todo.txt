TODO's for version 2.8
======================

- reformat and upload all documentation, schematics, etc. from the
  previous version
- battery support so as to achieve full portability. This requires:
    - hardware modifications: battery socket + a circuit for measuring
      the voltage level so as to get an idea as to whether the battery
      is running out. Idea: could run a line to the ADC and use the
      internal 2.56V reference (hopefully, it is not significantly
      affected by VCC variations). Might have to use a voltage divider,
      which should be isolated with a normally-closed FET.
    - powersaving: the main problem is the networking stuff. Keeping an
      Ethernet connection active prevents much ATMEGA idling and the
      ENC28J60 also draws a lot of power. Could implement some sort of
      "RJ45 plugged in" detection so that all networking components are
      shut down when there's nothing connected (the user would only
      visit the device with a laptop rather rarely anyway). With the
      networking components shut down, the ATMEGA would have very
      little work to do periodically and could be idle pretty much 99%
      of the time
- field test the device for days on end; check for timekeeping glitches
  (the RTC support is suspect) and consider sensor recalibration.
- stress-test the web interface
- test the web pages under Firefox and IE9 (they were mostly tested
  under Chrome so far)
- drop the time server options in the interface and replace them with
  a button to get the time from the user's workstation (HTTP header or
  sent via JavaScript?)
- microcode-based web content generation. Had been experimented with
  before, but much more feasible now when all the tokens are
  enumerated and the large constant text sections have all been moved
  off into the XSLT. Getting rid of all the if-switch overhead may well
  end up saving up to 50% in Flash program memory.
- perhaps bring back the FAT32 support, or at least Minix v1 format so
  that the card can be read again without much hassle
